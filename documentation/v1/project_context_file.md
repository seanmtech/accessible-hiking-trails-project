# Project Context: Accessible Outdoors Directory

I'm building a static directory site using Astro to list **accessible outdoor recreation options in the U.S.**. I want to help people find parks, trails, and campgrounds that offer accessibility features like wheelchair-friendly trails, accessible bathrooms, etc.

## Project Constraints

- Data comes from public datasets or APIs (Recreation.gov, NPS, OSM, etc.)
- Pages are generated at build time from normalized JSON
- Pages include: homepage, state-level index, location detail
- The goal is high-SEO, long-tail content with low maintenance
- Site will monetize via affiliate links, ads, or sponsorships later

## Tech Stack

- Astro + TailwindCSS
- Python scripts for scraping/cleaning
- Hosting via Vercel or Netlify
- GitHub repo with GitHub Actions for deploy + data refresh

## My Workflow

- I use ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot Agent in VS Code
- I work in short bursts and need to re-orient easily
- I prefer having a structured project that I can reuse for other ideas

## Where I Left Off

(You should edit this section regularly)
- ✅ Data source prototypes done (NPS + Rec.gov)
- ✅ Page routing set up in Astro
- 🟡 Need to finish filter component
- 🟡 Set up data refresh cron
